    "# This program will create a radar and distribution chart for Wyscout datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is structured to work on CSVs exported from Wyscout's 'Advanced Search' feature, with every single metric included.\n",
    "### If you haven't already, I recommend making a custom DISPLAY that has all variables. You can make (and save) this display by clicking the 'choose columns to display' button on the top right of the advanced search view.\n",
    "### Before making your first radar, please read the commented notes next to each variable in this first block.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TO RUN THE PROGRAM:\n",
    "#### To run the radar program, first run the second block of code. There are two total blocks: the first one is where you enter the info, the second is the program itself. You must run the second block (the program code) one time when you first boot this notebook up before running the first block (with the variables) or else it won't work. If you forget to run the second one first, no worries. Just run it and then run the first block again and you're set!\n",
    "#### The first block of code is the only place you really need to change anything unless you modify the progam's code itself. Enter all the required info (i.e. all but the savepath & imgpath variables) and then, after you've run the second block, you can run the first block. The radars & distribution chart will generate.\n",
    "##### (note that to save the distribution chart, you will need to right-click and save it. To get the text all correctly placed, I had to go \"outside\" the borders of the image that auto-saves. So, sorry but there's one manual step to saving that ;)\n",
